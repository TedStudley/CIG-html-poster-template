    <p>
      The overshoot problem in computational modeling is an effect which may 
      occur when attempting to model behavior of a field with a sharp or 
      discontinuous gradient. Gradients such as these, which may appear in 
      shockwave simulations or temperature advection and diffusion models, are 
      often necessary to represent an interface between materials or 
      conditions.

    <p>
      For example, a sharp temperature gradient may occur in 
      mantle convection simulation when a cold subducting slab comes into 
      contact with the warmer mantle. The overshoot problem is when overshoot
      and undershoot occur along a steep gradient, caused by inherent numeric
      instabilities in the method used to simulate the model in question.

    <p>
      For the purposes of this report, we will consider the overshoot problem in
      the mantle convection simulation code ASPECT (Advanced Solver for Problems 
      in Earth's ConvecTion) as well as in a small test code written explicitly
      to test the overshoot phenomenon.

    <p>
      ASPECT is a mantle convection simulation tool which uses a finite element
      solver to model the incompressible fluid flow of the Earth's mantle. Aspect
      was chosen for this poster as part of an attempt to find a solve the overshoot
      problem in a finite element mantle convection code which, to our knowledge, has
      not yet been accomplished. The overshoot problem in ASPECT occurs in two
      places: temperature advection and temperature diffusion. Temperature
      advection in ASPECT is done using a
