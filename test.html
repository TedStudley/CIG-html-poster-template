    <p>
      The overshoot problem in computational modeling is an effect which may 
      occur when attempting to model behavior of a field with a sharp or 
      discontinuous gradient.
    </p>
    <p> 
      Gradients such as these, which may appear in 
      shockwave simulations or temperature advection and diffusion models, are 
      often necessary to represent an interface between materials or 
      conditions. For example, a sharp temperature gradient may occur in 
      mantle convection simulation when a cold subducting slab comes into 
      contact with the warmer mantle. The overshoot problem is when overshoot
      and undershoot occur along a steep gradient, caused by inherent numeric
      instabilities in the method used to simulate the model in question.

      For the purposes of this report, we will consider the overshoot problem in
      the mantle convection simulation code ASPECT (Advanced Solver for Problems 
      in Earth's ConvecTion) as well as in a small test code written explicitly
      to test the overshoot phenomenon.

      ASPECT is a mantle convection simulation tool which uses a finite element
      solver to model the incompressible fluid flow of the Earth's mantle. 
      Aspect was chosen for this poster as part of an attempt to find a solve 
      the overshoot problem in a finite element mantle convection code which, 
      to our knowledge, has not yet been accomplished. The overshoot problem in
      ASPECT occurs in two places: temperature advection and temperature 
      diffusion. Both temperature advection and diffusion in ASPECT are solved
      using a semi-implicit BDF-2 scheme, which uses a multi-step backwards
      approximation to the finite difference approximation of $\frac{\delta T}{\delta t}$
      from times $t^{n}$, $t^{n-1}$, and $t^{n - 2}$. This provides an 
      up-to-second-order approximation to the exact solution of the 
      advection-diffusion equations, but is also capable of nonphysical 
      oscillations along sharp gradients when used in a finite element 
      formulation, causing the overshoot problem which we are attempting to 
      fix. To word towards determining the cause of this overshoot, we created
      a simple finite-difference code to experiment with possible causes and
      solutions in a more simplistic framework.

    <p>
      In a finite-difference code, the overshoot problem can again be broken 
      down into causes from temperature advection and temperature diffusion.
      In this way, the advection-diffusion equation $u_{t}+\beta\cdot\nabla
      {u}+\varepsilon\nabla^{2}{u}=0$ can be split into an advection equation
      $u_{t}=-\beta\cdot\nabla{u}$ and a diffusion equation $u_t=-\varepsilon
      \nabla^{2}{u}$. Then, each of these equations may be solved separately 
      to determine what causes in each case.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first case, for the advection equation, we may discretize the
      equation to be solved numerically using numeric equations (in the 1D
      case) as $\frac{u_{j}^{n+1}-u_{j}^{n}}{\Delta t} = -\beta [u_{j}^{n}]_{x}$, 
      or $u_{j}^{n+1}=u_{j}^{n} - \beta \Delta t [u_{j}^{n}]_{x}$. Then,the choice
      of solver depends upon our discretization of $[u_{j}^{n}]_{x}$, of which 
      there are several. The na&iuml;ve choice of discretization is the 
      backward-difference discretization, $[u_{j}^{n}]_{x}=\frac{u_{j+1}^{n}-
      u_{j}^{n}}{\Delta x}$, also known as the upwind method. In addition, one
      can create several second-order accurate methods by using a second term,
      yielding the second-order Lax-Wendroff, Beam-Warming, and Fromm methods:<br>
    </p>
    <equation-box>
      $\left[u_{j}^{n}\right]_{x}=\frac{u_{j+1}^{n}-u_{j}^{n}}{\Delta x} + \left[\frac{1}{2\Delta x}-\frac{\beta\Delta t}{\Delta x}\left(u_{j}^{n} - 2u_{j-1}^{n} + u_{j-2}^{n}\right)\right]$,<br>
      $\left[u_{j}^{n}\right]_{x}=\frac{u_{j+1}^{n}-u_{j}^{n}}{\Delta x} + \left[\frac{1}{2\Delta x}-\frac{\beta\Delta t}{\Delta x}\left(u_{j + 1}^{n} - 2u_{j}^{n} + u_{j-1}^{n}\right)\right]$, and<br>
      $\left[u_{j}^{n}\right]_{x}=\frac{u_{j+1}^{n}-u_{j}^{n}}{\Delta x} + \left[\frac{1}{4\Delta x} - \frac{\beta\Delta t}{2\Delta x}\left(u_{j + 1}^{n} - u_{j}^{n} - u_{j - 1}^{n} + u_{j - 2}^{n}\right)\right]$, respectively.
    </equation-box>
    <p>
      Upwind method does not overshoot on discontinuous data but is innacurate, while Lax Wendroff, Beam-Warming, and Fromm's methods are more accurate, but do overshoot on discontinuous data.
